# Sonar Fusion Engine Development Plan

## Philosophy: Math-First, Test-Driven, Modular Design

**Core Principle**: Build a mathematically rigorous foundation first, then layer on features. Every component should be testable in isolation.

Raw Sensor Data → Preprocessing → Association → State Estimation → Output
```
